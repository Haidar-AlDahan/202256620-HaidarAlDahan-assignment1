- ChatGPT

## How AI Was Used

AI was used during this assignment for:

1. Some HTML layout structuring and portfolio suggestions.
2. Full CSS first implementaion based on my HTML implementation to begin modifying based ony my needs.
3. Implementing JavaScript features such as:
   - Theme toggle (Light/Dark)
4. Reviewing code structure and suggesting improvements.
5. Help ensuring the page is responsive as required.
## Modifications & Verification

All AI-generated suggestions were reviewed and adjusted before being added to the project.

Examples of modifications:
- Adjusted variable naming for clarity.
- Simplified validation logic for readability.
- Modified CSS spacing and layout decisions.

The final code reflects personal understanding and manual refinement.

## Benefits of Using AI

- Faster debugging.
- Better understanding of clean layout structure.
- Improved JavaScript organization.
- Exposure to best practices in responsive design.

## Challenges & Limitations

- Some suggestions required restructuring to match assignment constraints.
- Certain design recommendations were simplified to avoid over-design.
- Ensured that the final code remained understandable and maintainable.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this process I improved:
- Semantic HTML structuring
- CSS layout control using Grid and Flexbox
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Responsible AI-assisted development workflow

AI was used as a support tool, not as a replacement for understanding.
